# Introduction
The aim of the project is to implement "ELECTRICITYBILLINGSYSTEM". The Electricity Bill calculator project is the application based mini project, which is used to predict the electricity bill of next month by taking input of appliance or load used. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach.

# Research
People who donâ€™t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming months, however, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:
Power rating of all loads
Total load calculation
Unit consumed per day
Units consumed per month

In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:
-Electricity bill calculation in urban areas
-Electricity bill calculation in rural areas
-Bill calculation based on units consumed

# Cost and Time
This is the plot of cost of the calculators in ($ ) and time in years

# Swot Analysis
Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.

# 4W's and 1'H
who : office

What: Electricity bill calculator**

Where: School, Science, domestic, industries, Technology

When: Need for calculation

How: Calculates the user input as number of loads and gives the output.
